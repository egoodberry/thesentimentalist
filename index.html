            <p>
              Krista is a tea-drinking, heirloom-shopping lady versed in all things Atlanta,
              etiquette, and lovely. Born, raised, and married in the shop’s neighborhood,
              she is a naturally sentimental gal who holds dear her family, home, and grade-school
              sweetheart. After a career in nursing and a lifetime of being everyone’s
              go-to tastemaker, she found her fit in the finery of bridal fashion.

            <h2 class="gabi">Meet Gabi</h2>
            <p>
              Gabi is a peach with time spent on the West Coast, planning parties and playing
              with wedding dresses. After learning from the best with Portland’s sweetest
              bridal boutique and favorite planning group, Gabi was excited to move home
              and bring some of her favorite independent designers with her. She has an
              eye for fit, a tendency for vintage, and a passion for color. She believes
              in lipstick, soul food, and old trucks, and she just loves helping brides
              find their perfect dress mate.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>

          <div class="grid_6 alpha">
            <section class="questions">
              <p class="question">Do I need an appointment?</p>
              <p class="answer">You are welcome to walk in anytime during the week, but we do require appointments on Saturday and Sunday. Weekend appointments last one hour and are made on the hour.</p>
              <p class="question">Do you sell dresses off the rack?</p>
              <p class="answer">We primarily sell our designer dresses by “special order” and recommend this route, but sometimes our samples can be available for purchase off the rack at a discount.  Our vintage dresses are all sold off the rack.</p>
              <p class="question">How does the special order process work?</p>
              <p class="answer">All of the dresses in our shop that you will be trying on are samples.  We only carry one sample in one size of each of our styles. Once you have selected a dress, we take your measurements and compare them to the designer's size chart. The dresses are made in standard sizes, so we will work with you in choosing the best size for you, but alterations are to be expected.  We then order your specific dress and have it shipped to our shop.</p>
              <p class="question">What if the samples aren’t in my size?</p>
              <p class="answer">We strive to carry samples sizes that will work for most brides, but samples will rarely fit perfectly. We have our own arsenal of tricks and tools to help provide an idea of how the dress will look in your size.</p>
              <p class="question">How long does it take to get my dress?</p>
              <p class="answer">Most designer production time takes about 12 to 14 weeks. After we receive your order, it will take about 5 days to process.  We will provide you with an estimated ship date and keep you updated as that date is refined.</p>
              <p class="question">What about alterations?</p>
              <p class="answer">Alterations are just about always to be expected.  We don’t provide in-house alterations, but we are happy to share a short list of alteration references.</p>
              <p class="question">Can I bring my bridal party?</p>
              <p class="answer">Our little shop is designed to offer an intimate shopping experience, so it’s best to bring a small party. Because our space is limited, we wouldn’t recommend bringing more than 4 people. If you are traveling with a large group or need special assistance, just call ahead of time and let us know.</p>
              <p class="question">Do you have bridesmaids’ dresses?</p>
              <p class="answer">We do not currently carry bridesmaids’ dresses. We will have social dresses visiting and available for special order with certain designers’ trunk shows.</p>
              <p class="question">Do you have a specific dress I am looking for?</p>
              <p class="answer">We only carry a selection of samples from each of the designers we carry, but we can special order any dress from our designers’ available collections. Just call us if you are looking for a specific dress.</p>
              <p class="question">Do you offer any discounts on your dresses?</p>
              <p class="answer">We work hard to offer a range of reasonably priced dresses.  Our dress prices are determined by material costs and the time it makes to create such special garments. Because we respect our designers and want to support their craft, discounts are only extended during sample sales, trunk shows, and other special promotions.</p>

              <img src="images/tips.png" alt="Tips for Visiting" />
              <hr />
              <h3>Do A Little Research</h3>
              <p>Explore our website a bit and take a look at our designers.</p>
              <h3>Come Prepared</h3>
              <p>Dress comfortably and wear socks if you aren’t comfortable going barefoot.  Also, go light on the makeup, tanner, and jewelry before trying on our pretty white dresses.</p>
              <p>Bring a small but great team. A small, supportive team of family and friends is best for accomplishing a pleasant and productive appointment.</p>
              <h3>Weekday Visiting</h3>
              <p>We recommend dropping in during the week in order to take your time with our dresses and do a little preliminary shopping. We are also happy to have you try on dresses during the week, as it’s often less busy and more relaxed.</p>
              <h3>Keep An Open Mind</h3>
              <p>We always recommend trying on more than less. If anything catches your eye, try it on! You will learn more about what you really want by trying on several styles and keeping an open mind. The dress you fall in love with might not be what you had in mind, and that only makes it extra special!</p>
